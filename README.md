Insurance claim processing use case
---

Example implementation of a use case mentioned by Alistair Cockburn in this
article: ["Structuring use cases with goals"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170620145208/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Structuring+use+cases+with+goals).

Here is a link to the companion article for this code on Medium.

**Disclaimer**
A lot of terminology used in the code is taken from Alistair's original article. I've tried to mark these occurrences
clearly in the relevant comments (i.e.: with quotes).
